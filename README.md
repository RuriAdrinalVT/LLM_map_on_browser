1) This is my example of locally run LLM for Python MISTRAL model. This is an AI model Machine learning which also the Python code modify with DeepSeek1.5b model to be train into the system.

2) I have more example if you interesting which may increase the Machine learning/training SPEED and speed-up/expedite the machine learning process on use of flash memory/stack and DMA combination of the LINUX distribution/ANDROID linux distribution.
